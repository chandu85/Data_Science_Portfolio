## Introduction
Over the time there have been many technological advancements in aviation industry in affordability, monitoring, navigation, and maintenance. These technological advancements have made the air travel much safer and much affortable to the common man. There are close to `80 Million` passengers availing the air travel option per month as of January 2020, this huge number of passengers proves how sophisticated and safe air travel is overall.

In this post I would like to present different statistical data showing how much safer the air travel has become over the time, how does it compare to other means of travel with a goal to establish how safe the air travel is.

## Project Motivation
- To evaluate the concerns related to the mortality rate involved in air travel when compared other means of travel.
- Under the true picture of mortality rates for air travel when compared to other means.
- Understand how different countries and airlines are performing with respect to aviation safety.

## Data Background
1. Main data: Airline Safety.
2. Motor vehicle fatality rate in US.
3. TSA Data to get number of people travel within US.
4. Air traffic control data to get some insights into air traffic in US.

## Prerequisite
- Power BI

## Method Used
- Used PowerBI to extract different details from both airline safety as well as vehicle fatality rate datasets to come up with the comparison between airline safety when compared with other means of transportation.

## Potential Issues?
- Extracting the required data was challenge as data is not uniform across several years. I had used data from last 20 years for comparison.

## Acknowledgement
Aviation industry is highly sophisticated, very competitive and constantly evolving. We will be amazed if we think about the emerging and evolving innovations regarding comfort and safety in the airlines space. Ranging from evolving cockpit technology, constant flight status monitoring, passenger cabin safety measures, ultra modern communication through air traffic control and airport control, security checking and airport safety, - all work together to provide a better and safer travel experience. Considering all the aspects, air travel is arguably the safest means of travelling in the present era.
