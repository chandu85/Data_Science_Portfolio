Thank you for visting my site, I am Chandramouli Yalamanchili. I am originally from India, staying in U.S.A for last 9 years. I work as mainframe programmer in financial or banking domain. As part of our day to day job, we deal with massive amounts of data related to credit card or debit card transactions. Over the last few years I have noticed a huge demand for the data from various clients, everyone wanted to receive the authorization data in near real time and want to come up with some real time insights. Being in the center of this processing, I wanted to gain more understanding on what I can do with this data and there by help my team as well as the firm. That's where I got my data science interest from and joined the Bellevue University's Data Science course.
