## Introduction
The goal of this project is to use Python requests package and pull data from internet and then parse the JSON payload to format the response back to end-user. Through this project, I have gained knowledge about making the web service calls in Python, I have also understood the code that is needed to be able to parse the JSON payload, which is the common message format used for RESTful APIs. This project has helped me to be prepared to write Python code needed to ingest the data from API services to consume data in real time.

## Usage
- Create an account with openWeather website to get the API key that can be used for API calls.
- Install all of the Python packages needed.
- Execute the Python code on the terminal to start the interactive session to pull the data from open weather API.

## Method Used
- Used Python code for this project.
- Create code to accept either zip code or city name from user and then use the open weather API to retrieve the weather data for that city or zip.
- And finally, parse the JSON API response received from open weather service and print it back to user in an easily readable format.
