## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a Keras based CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) classifier model that would evaluate the patches collected from several whole mount slide images and accurately classify a histology image as benign or malignant.

## Method Used
- Used Python and Jupyter notebook for this project.
- Perform data visualization and summary functions to understand the dataset.
- Apply data engineering needed to make the data ready for modeling.
- Finally build a CNN model, train the same to be able to predict cancer cells from IDC histology images.
