<p align="center">Welcome to my data science portfolio</p>

<p align="center"><b>About Me</b></p>
I am Chandramouli Yalamanchili. I am originally from India, staying in U.S.A for last 9 years. I work as mainframe programmer in financial or banking domain.<br/>
As part of our day to day job, we deal with massive amounts of data related to credit card or debit card transactions. Over the last few years I have noticed a huge demand for the data from various clients, everyone wanted to receive the authorization data in near real time and want to come up with some real time insights. Being in the center of this processing, I wanted to gain more understanding on what I can do with this data and there by help my team as well as the firm. That's where my data science interest comes from and made me join the Bellevue University's Data Science course.

# Projects
Here is the collection of different data science projects I have worked on:

[Project 1 - Credit Card Fraud Detection](Project%201%20-%20Creditcard%20Fraud%20detection/):
As part of this porject I will build a machine learning model that will predict fraudulent transactions.

[Project 2 - Air Travel Safety Analysis](Project%202%20-%20Air%20Travel%20Safety/):
As part of this project I have used several visualization techniques to review the safety of air travel when compared with other means of transportation.

[Project 3 - US Permanent Visa](#):
This project involves EDA process to extract the data for modeling and then run the data through a prediction model to be about to predict visa approval status provided the input features.

[Project 4 - Sentiment Analysis of IMDB moview reviews](#):
In this project I will create a model that would establish the sentiment for a movie review comment from IMDB.

[Project 5 - Image classification model](#):
In this project I will create a Keras CNN model that would classify the images and then evaluate its performance.

[Project 6 - Stock Price Prediction](#):
In this project I will create a neural network to predict if a stock price is going to raise considering the historic details.

[Project 7 - House Price Prediction](#):
In this project I will create a regression model to predict house price based on the selected feature list.

[Project 8 - Credit Card Customer Segmentation](#):
In this project I will create a clustering model to extract segments of customers depending on their behaviour patterns.

[Project 9 - Weather application](#):
This project is to explore different types of data ingestion mechanisms available, this project will mainly concentrate on pulling the data from web using API.

[Project 10 - Stroke Prediction](#):
This project is to build a model that predicts the stroke based on the features provided.
