This project will attempt to build a machine learning model that will predict fraudulent transactions.

[Project 2 - Air Travel Safety Analysis](Project%202%20-%20Air%20Travel%20Safety/):
As part of this project I have used several visualization techniques to review the safety of air travel when compared with other means of transportation.
