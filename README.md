<p align="center">Welcome to my data science portfolio</p>

<p align="center"><b>About Me</b></p>
I am Chandramouli Yalamanchili. I am originally from India, staying in U.S.A for last 9 years. I work as mainframe programmer in financial or banking domain. 
As part of our day to day job, we deal with massive amounts of data related to credit card or debit card transactions. Over the last few years I have noticed a huge demand for the data from various clients, everyone wanted to receive the authorization data in near real time and want to come up with some real time insights. Being in the center of this processing, I wanted to gain more understanding on what I can do with this data and there by help my team as well as the firm. That's where my data science interest comes from and made me join the Bellevue University's Data Science course.

# Projects
Here is the collection of different data science projects I have worked on:

[Project 1 - Credit Card Fraud Detection](Project%201%20-%20Creditcard%20Fraud%20detection/):
This project will attempt to build a machine learning model that will predict fraudulent transactions.

[Project 2 - Air Travel Safety Analysis](Project%202%20-%20Air%20Travel%20Safety/):
As part of this project I have used several visualization techniques to review the safety of air travel when compared with other means of transportation.
